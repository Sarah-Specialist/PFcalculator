## Introduction
This is my individual project for the SkillsUnion/NTU Software Developer Immersive course. I have created a PaO2/FiO2 calculator based on my experience in healthcare. This tool helps physicians understand the patient’s lung condition and oxygenation status. This is typically used for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The PaO2/FiO2 calculator features all the following:
- input validation
- mathematics calculation
- mouseover event
- radio buttons that autofill input text.

## Getting Started

### Usage
#### Definition
PaO2 refers to the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood

FiO2 refers to the fraction of inspired oxygen – concentration of oxygen in a gas mixture

A simple definition of PaO2/FiO2 ratio is given in the information box when hovering over the “?” icon on the top right corner.

#### Clinical setting
In a real clinical setting, the PaO2 value should be obtained by running an arterial blood gas (ABG) through the ABG machine. The FiO2 value is collected by observing the patient’s oxygen device or getting the FiO2 setting on the ventilator. 

The FiO2 value might not be easily observed if the patient is on a device that does not explicitly state the FiO2. For example, the FiO2 on nasal prongs and non-rebreather mask is not clearly stated. This tool provides a convenient way to access the FiO2 values for these devices without memorization! As a rule of thumb, the FiO2 increases 4% from room air (FiO2 21%) for every liter of oxygen added to nasal prongs. 

e.g. 2L of nasal prongs = 21% + (4% x 2L) = 29%

Meanwhile, the FiO2 on a non-rebreather mask is estimated to be approximately 100%.
